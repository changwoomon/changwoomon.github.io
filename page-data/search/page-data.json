Post file structure\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to add a new document. The first is to create a markdown file for a single document without a directory. If you are writing about JavaScript, you can create a `about-javascript.md` file in the `contents/posts` directory.\r\n\r\nThe second is to create a directory and create an `index.md` file in it. This method is useful when the document contains several additional files such as picture files.\r\n\r\nEach file name or directory name becomes a unique address of the document and can be accessed as follows. `https://siteURL/about-javascript`.\r\n\r\n### 1-2. Frontmatter\r\n\r\nThe Markdown document you create contains the document's metadata called frontmatter.\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"ðŸ¤” 3. Writing Guide\"\r\ndescription: \"How to write and add a post?\"\r\ndate: 2021-05-03\r\nupdate: 2021-05-03\r\ntags:\r\n  - hoodie\r\n  - writing-guide\r\nseries: \"Getting started your blog with Hoodie\"\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove is the frontmatter of the document you are currently reading. Among them, title and date are required. It is recommended to enclose the string with spaces in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n### 1-3. Writing markdown\r\n\r\nIf you have written a Frontmatter, you can write your markdown document under it. Hoodie supports most Markdown syntax. To learn more about Markdown syntax, see the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) documentation on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## 2. Syntax Highlighting & Katex\r\n\r\n### 2-1. Syntax Highlighting\r\n\r\nSyntax highlighting based on Prism.JS is supported.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nJavascript\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt supports a wider variety of other languages. Check it out on the [Prism.js website](https://prismjs.com/).\r\n\r\n### 2-2. Katex\r\n\r\nIt supports Katex syntax, you can easily express complex formulas.\r\n\r\n#### Inline mode\r\n\r\n$$E = m c^{2}$$\r\n\r\n#### Block mode\r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(x) dx\r\n$$\r\n\r\n## 3. Add images to a post\r\n\r\nYou can easily embed images using relative paths. It is easy to manage documents containing images by creating a directory.\r\n\r\n![](sample-image.jpg)\r\n\r\nImages are loaded with Lazy Loading, so you can secure fast document loading speed.\r\n\r\n> âš  The extension of the file must be set to lowercase.\r\n\r\n## 4. Tagging\r\n\r\n![](tag-example.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou can classify and search documents by tag set in Frontmatter. All tags you set can be viewed and searched in `https://siteUrl/tags`.\r\n\r\n## 5. Series\r\n\r\n![](series-example.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou can publish multiple related documents in a series. The series set in Frontmatter is grouped together and shown at the top of the document. This can be useful for serialized documents with an order. Series documents are displayed in ascending order of creation date.\r\n\r\nThe current document is also set in a series called `Getting started your blog with Hoodie`.\r\n"},{"excerpt":"Getting started your blog with Hoodie by following steps below.

Quick Start","tags":["hoodie","quick-start"]},"rawMarkdownBody":"\r\nGetting started your blog with Hoodie by following steps below. It's very easy ðŸ˜‰.\r\n\r\n## 1. Create a Gatsby site\r\n\r\n> Make sure you have **node.js** and **gatsby-cli** installed on your computer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npx gatsby new my-hoodie-blog https://github.com/devHudi/Hoodie\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Start dev server\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd my-hoodie-blog\r\n$ npm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can access to your blog at localhost:8000.\r\n\r\n## 3. Create your own Github repository\r\n\r\nUtterance comment widget is based on **Github issue system**. So you need your own GitHub repository. Also, if you want to publish your blog through Github Pages or Netlify, the Github Repository is a necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to create a GitHub repository, follow the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).\r\n\r\n### Add remote repository\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git init\r\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Write blog-config.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  title: \"MY BLOG\",\r\n  description: \"Hello, This is my blog\",\r\n  author: \"YOUR NAME\",\r\n  siteUrl: \"https://myblog.com\",\r\n  links: {\r\n    github: \"https://github.com\",\r\n    facebook: \"https://www.facebook.com\",\r\n    instagram: \"https://www.instagram.com\",\r\n    etc: \"https://www.google.com/\",\r\n  },\r\n  utterances: {\r\n    repo: \"{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}\",\r\n    type: \"pathname\",\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHoodie provides a configuration file called `blog-config.js`. In this file, you can configure blog, biography (profile), and utterance. The website settings you are currently viewing are as above.\r\n\r\nConfigure `blog-config.js` to suit your blog. However, it is recommended not to modify `utterances.type`.\r\n\r\n### Change profile image\r\n\r\nReplace `src/images/profile.png` with the image you want. To change the image file name, you need to change the source code of `src/components/Bio.jsx`.\r\n\r\n## 5. Add your content\r\n\r\nMarkdown content is in `contents/posts`. You can write and add your articles like the sample posts here. [Click here](/writing-guide) to see the detail writing guide.\r\n\r\n## 6. Deploy your blog\r\n\r\n### 6-1 via Netlify\r\n\r\nFollow the Connecting to Netlify steps in [A Step-by-Step Guide: Gatsby on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/). It's not difficult.\r\n\r\nIf you connect the github repository using Netlify, it is automatically distributed whenever you push it, so it is convenient.\r\n\r\n### 6-2. via Github Pages\r\n\r\n#### Case 1\r\n\r\nIf the repository name contains .github.io (if your GitHub page URL is `https://{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}.github.io`) run the following command to deploy.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run deploy-gh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 2\r\n\r\nIf the repository name is different from your GitHub name (if your GitHub page URL is `https://{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}.github.io/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}`) run the following command to deploy.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run deploy-gh-prefix-paths\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above case, you need to change `pathPrefix` in `gatsby-config.js` to your repository name.\r\n\r\n### 6-3. other platforms\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can build the gatsby website with the command above. The build output is created in the `/public` directory. Deploy the `/public` directory using the command for the platform you want to deploy.\r\n\r\n## 7. Cutomize\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\n\r\nYou can customize your own Hoodie by referring to the following file structure ðŸ™Š.\r\n\r\n```\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ node_modules\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ contents\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ posts // your articles are here\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ public // build outputs are here\r\nâ””â”€â”€ src\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ assets\r\n    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ theme // theme config is here\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ components\r\n    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Article\r\n    â”‚    Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Body\r\n    â”‚        Â Â  â””â”€â”€ StyledMarkdown\r\n    â”‚            Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.jsx // markdown styles are here\r\n    â”‚   ...\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ fonts // webfonts are here\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ hooks\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ images\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ pages // page components are here\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ reducers\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ templates // post components are here\r\n    â””â”€â”€ utils\r\n```\r\n"},{"excerpt":"About Hoodie Hoodie is a gatsby theme created for writing tech blogs.
