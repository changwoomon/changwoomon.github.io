Getting started your blog with Hoodie by following steps below. It's very easy ðŸ˜‰.

## 1. Create a Gatsby site

> Make sure you have **node.js** installed on your computer.

```
$ npx gatsby new my-hoodie-blog https://github.com/devHudi/Hoodie
```

## 2. Start dev server

```
$ cd my-hoodie-blog
$ npm run start
```

Now you can access to your blog at localhost:8000.

## 3. Create your own Github repository

Utterance comment widget is based on **Github issue system**. So you need your own GitHub repository. Also, if you want to publish your blog through Github Pages or Netlify, the Github Repository is a necessary.

If you don't know how to create a GitHub repository, follow the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

### Add remote repository

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}
```

## 4. Write blog-config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  title: "Hoodie.gatsby",
  description: "Hello :) I'm Hudi who developed Hoodie theme.",
  author: "Hudi",
  siteUrl: "https://hudi.blog",
  links: {
    github: "https://github.com/devHudi",
    facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057724153835",
    instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/dawn_fromeast/",
    etc: "https://www.notion.so/Hudi-s-R-sum-0c1d1a1b35284d1eaf05c5bfac4a3cad",
  },
  utterances: {
    repo: "devHudi/Hoodie",
    type: "pathname",
  },
}
```

Hoodie provides a configuration file called `blog-config.js`. In this file, you can configure blog, biography (profile), and utterance. The website settings you are currently viewing are as above.

Configure `blog-config.js` to suit your blog. However, it is recommended not to modify `utterances.type`.

## 5. Add your content

Markdown content is in `contents/posts`. You can write and add your articles like the sample posts here. [Click here](/writing-guide) to see the detail writing guide.

## 6. Deploy your blog

### 6-1 via Netlify

Follow the Connecting to Netlify steps in [A Step-by-Step Guide: Gatsby on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/). It's not difficult.

If you connect the github repository using Netlify, it is automatically distributed whenever you push it, so it is convenient.

### 6-2. via Github Pages

#### Case 1

If the repository name is the same as your GitHub name (if your GitHub page URL is `https://{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}.github.io`) run the following command to deploy.

```
$ npm run deploy-gh
```

#### Case 2

If the repository name is different from your GitHub name (if your GitHub page URL is `https://{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}.github.io/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}`) run the following command to deploy.

```
$ npm run deploy-gh-prefix-paths
```

In the above case, you need to change `pathPrefix` in `gatsby-config.js` to your repository name.

### 6-3. other platforms

```
$ npm run build
```

You can build the gatsby website with the command above. The build output is created in the `/public` directory. Deploy the `/public` directory using the command for the platform you want to deploy.
